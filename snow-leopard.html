            Snow leopard, large long-haired Asian cat, classified as either Panthera uncia or Uncia uncia in the family Felidae. 
            The snow leopard inhabits the mountains of central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, ranging from an elevation of about 1,800 metres (about 6,000 feet) in the winter to about 5,500 metres (18,000 feet) in the summer.
            Its soft coat, consisting of a dense insulating undercoat and a thick outercoat of hairs about 5 cm (2 inches) long, is pale grayish with dark rosettes and a dark streak along the spine.

            The underparts, on which the fur may be 10 cm (4 inches) long, are uniformly whitish. 
            The snow leopard attains a length of about 2.1 metres (7 feet), including the 0.9-metre- (3-foot-) long tail. 
            It stands about 0.6 metre (2 feet) high at the shoulder and weighs 23-41 kg (50-90 pounds). 
            It hunts at night and preys on various animals, such as marmots, wild sheep, ibex (Capra), and domestic livestock. Its litters of two to four young are born after a gestation period of approximately 93 days.
