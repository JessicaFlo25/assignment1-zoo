        Capybaras are short-haired brownish rodents with blunt snouts, short legs, small ears, and almost no tail. 
        They are shy and associate in groups along the banks of lakes and rivers. 
        They normally feed in the morning and evening and spend most of the day resting under cover along the banks. 
        They are vegetarian and in cultivated areas sometimes become pests by eating melons, grain, and squash. 
        They swim and dive readily and commonly enter water to elude predators such as jaguars and anacondas.
